## Welcome to NAYEON's github page!!

Hello~~ My name is Nayeon Kim and I'm 21 in korean age.

I entered Handong Global University in 2019 and now I am in 2nd grade.

I am afraid and trembling as a newcomer in my major, but I am looking forward to it.

On this page, I want to talk about my major and interests~!!

### MY MAJOR based on MY INTERESTS

**My first major in Handong University is Biology.**  
I liked science since I was a child, especially life science.

```markdown
This year is my first grade in Biology department.
This semester, I am taking general microbiology 
and organic chemistry classes out of Biology classes.
In class,We study small, invisible creatures 
such as bacteria and viruses, 
and study chemical properties and reactions 
related to organic matter. 
I'm still having fun studying 
and it's hard but rewarding.

**My second major in Handong University is Computer Science.**  
Last year I had fun learning coding and became interested in this field.

```markdown
This year is my first grade in Computer Science department.
This semester, I am taking data structure, java programing
and open source software out of Computer Science classes.
In class,We study how to process data for good programs 
and learn basic Java language 
and deal with open software sources. 
It's harder and more complicated than I thought, 
but it seems quite fun.

I am currently studying at Handong Global University.  
I love our university and I met many good friends and professors here.
